\usage{
build_palette(
  name,
  colrange = list(colour = NULL, difC = NULL),
  flipVertical = FALSE,
  flipHorizontal = FALSE,
  subtractive = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Name of colour palette or \code{usr} for option to design a new
palette. Colour palette names include
\code{BlueYellow}, \code{CyanMagenta}, \code{BlueRed} and
\code{GreenBlue}.}

\item{colrange}{List with a character vector of length two called colour and a numeric
vector of length two called difC. colour contains two colour names
from the colours() range or valid hexadecimal colors. difC contains two
integers (1, 2, 3 or 4), which control how much a colour changes in value across the grid.
One corresponds with a small change in colour value, and four corresponds with a large
change in colour value.}

\item{flipVertical}{Whether the palette should be flipped vertically (ie. replace top portion with bottom portion)}

\item{flipHorizontal}{Whether the palette should be flipped horizontally (ie. replace left portion with right portion)}

\item{subtractive}{A logical evaluating to TRUE or FALSE indicating whether the colour mixing is subtractive or additive}
}
\description{
This function prepares one of the four included colour palettes
or builds a new colour palette.
}
\details{
Note that \code{colrange} only needs to be specified if \code{name = "usr."}
When choosing colours, it is best to avoid light colours or tints as these
will lead to a colour palette lacking noticeable differences across the 3 x 3
colour grid.
Note that \code{subtractive = FALSE} allows for additive colour mixing under
the RGB colour wheel while \code{subtractive = TRUE} allows for subtractive
colour mixing under the RYB colour wheel.

\examples{
# use one of four prepared colour palettes
p <- build_palette(name = "CyanMagenta")
view(p)

# use subtractive colour mixing (blue + yellow = green)
p <- build_palette(name = "BlueYellow", subtractive = TRUE)
view(p)

# design a new palette
p <- build_palette(name = "usr", colrange =
 list(colour = c("darkblue", "chartreuse4"), difC = c(3, 4)))
view(p)

}
